            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thee in publiſhing a Pamphlet ſo faultie and with ſo many wants. The iniurie to me is, becauſe that was giuen forth to be mine, which I did neuer write, nor read ouer written by others, vntill I ſaw it in print. When my children firſt began to ſpeake for the furtherance of them and my ſeruants in the knowledge of the Hiſtorie of the Bible, after a Chapter read at our meales, at dinner out of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at ſupper out of the new: I gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by word of mouth onely, ſuch obſeruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as I thought fit for their capacitie &amp; vnderſtanding, and by their anſwers to my queſtions, I daily tooke an account how they vnderſtood and retained the<pb facs="tcp:567:3"/>ſame in memorie. After 26. yeares con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in this exerciſe, by ſome vnad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed youth, or vndiſcreete ſeruant of mine, ſome Printer gate it: wherof whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I had an inckling, I trauelled to ſome in authoritie, and by labouring with them gat it ſtaied not to be printed in Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet it comming forth, they printing it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwhere without my knowledge or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: I thought it my dutie beeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to intreated alſo by others, to read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and in ſome ſort to redreſſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe offered vnto thee by the former Impreſſion. And I beſeech the Lord to bleſſe this and all other my labours in ſome meaſure to be profitable to thee &amp; his church.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> 1. He ſet the crowne of the kingdome vpon her head.</p>
            <p>2 He made a feaſt to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ſeruants.</p>
            <p>3. He gaue reſt to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces and gifts according to the power of a king.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A. Two things fell out: the firſt, he diſcouered a practiſe of treaſon againſt the King: the traitours were found and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and the preuention of it was recorded in the Chronicles as done by Mordecai.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What was the ſecond?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> A miſchieuous practiſe of the confuſion of the Iewes.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By whom was it deuiſed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. By Haman a proud man, a great courtier, and highly in fauour with the King.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Why did he enuie the Iewes ſo much as to ſeeke to bring them into ſuch danger?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Becauſe that Mordecai did not bow the knee to him, nor reuerence him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>A. Becauſe that Haman was an Agagite of the ſtocke of the Amalechites, a people hated, forſaken, and curſed of God, becauſe they came firſt out to fight againſt Iſrael in the wilderneſſe,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 17.8.1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Was his pride ſuch, that for enuie to one man, he ſought to deſtroy the whole kindred of the Iewes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>By what meanes did hee bring them into this danger?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He vſed two reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: the firſt was, that they were troubleſome, not keeping the kings law. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, it ſhould be for the kings profit, for there ſhould be ten thouſand talents of ſiluer paid to the king to deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:567:103"/>
               <hi>Q. Did Haman preuaile by theſe reaſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Yea, the King gaue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to Haman to doe as he pleaſed: the edict was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſealed with the kings ring, ſent by poſts into al his prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to kill and deſtroy all the Iewes in one day, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he prepared a paire of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes for Mordecai.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. This beeing concluded, how is it regarded?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It is taken diuerſly: The King and Haman ſit feaſting and drinking. The people fall to mourning and crying.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Thus wee haue gone tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the firſt part of the booke, and haue ſeene the danger deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, concluded and appointed to be executed, and we are come to the ſecond part of the booke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the auoiding of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.<pb n="101" facs="tcp:567:103"/>How many things haue we in this part of the booke to conſider?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Two: firſt the meanes vſed to preuent this danger: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coudly the euent, and ſucceſſe of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. For the firſt, who are the parties who doe ſeeke meanes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. The parties who firſt heard of it, as Mordecai and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpecially; or the people of the Iewes generally.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. VVhat doth Mordecai?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. Hee doth firſt humble himſelf before the Lord by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and ſeeketh helpe of him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he maketh the cauſe knowne to Eſter, that ſhe might be an interceſſour to the king for them.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Doth Eſter follow the cauſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. At the firſt ſhee is feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, doubteth the kings fauour, and maketh excuſes.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> Mordecai with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible faith in Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, aſſureth himſelfe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance of Gods people: but threatneth deſtruction to her &amp; to her fathers houſe, for deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the cauſe and the people of God.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What meanes doth ſhee and the people then vſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Firſt, ſhee commandeth a faſt to all the Iewes three daies and three nights: ſecondly, ſhe promiſeth that ſhe and her maides wil doe the like: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, thus prepared, ſhe reſolueth to goe to the king, ſaying: If I periſh, I periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. Theſe meanes beeing vſed to God, what meanes doth ſhee vſe to the king?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Shee banketted the king and Haman day after day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<pb n="203" facs="tcp:567:104"/>ſhe knew that he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in bankets, and in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God turneth all to the beſt, for hee bringeth ſhame and confuſion to his enemies, and deliuerance to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>How is this brought to paſſe?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God cauſeth the King to remember how hee was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from treaſon by Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decaies meanes, and therefore commanded that in royall ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the Kings horſe with a crowne vpon his head, Haman ſhould lead him about the citie.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Q. What brought him to this aduerſitie?</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> God was the principall cauſe, who did it onely to trie him. Sathan as a ſeruant, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice &amp; hatred onely to deſtroy him: the Sabees and Chaldees to ſatisfie their crueltie and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, killed his ſeruants, and ſtole away his cattell: the fire from heauen burnt his ſheepe, the winde blew downe the houſe &amp; killed his children,<pb n="211" facs="tcp:567:108"/>and the contemptuous skornes of many entred into his ſoule.</p>

               <hi>Q. What doth Iob in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> He defended the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie with many paſſions, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the conflicts &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates betweene the fleſh &amp; the ſpirit; truſt and diſtruſt, hope &amp; deſpaire.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Elihu is angrie with both<pb n="213" facs="tcp:567:109"/>parties, and refuted them: God findeth fault with Iob for deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to plead with him, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is not able to contend with his creature, eſpecially Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemoth and Leuiathan, much leſſe with him.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Iob repented, ſerued God and prayed, and ſo God iuſtified him, and condemned his friends.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Wee are come to the laſt part, which is his reſtoring againe: who reſtored him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. God, the gluer of euery good gift.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. How did he reſtore him?</hi>
